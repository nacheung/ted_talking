# Ted Talking

TED conferences have been around in some form or another since 1984, with thousands of TED events held since then. These conferences feature dozens of talks on a wide range of topics, and by and large are filmed and uploaded to YouTube and/or the TED website. With so many talks presented each year, it can be easy to overlook those talks which donâ€™t just go viral on YouTube. We want to help TED enjoyers find talks on themes that they are interested in, which they might miss otherwise. We hope to allow users to explore relationships within the talks they are interested in, information about the speakers, and how TED talk themes have changed over time.
